      </ul>
      <p>The first recital at Middlefield features a lineup of 2 great works alongside a new and original work composed by Charles Geday. Beethoven's Path√©tique Sonata was the first example of the Romantic ideals in the composer's piano repertoire, with its thick chords and firey themes. Charles Geday's latest composition, a set of short pieces, gets its public debut at this recital as the first piece from the set- entitled Waltz in A- is the second piece in this programme. The final work to be performed is the first prelude from Bach's famed Well-Tempered Klavier, an iconic work which revels in its apparent simplicity yet there it more to this work than meets the eye.</p>
